# GHMC Ward Level Data Set Showing Agency Wise details for different WorksÂ¶
by IDFC Institute


Background:

Allocation of Funds & Expenditure for financial year 2014-15 to 2016-17
This data was complied through multiple RTI's and petitioning the High Court.

The Dataset covers all invoices by the GHMC over the last 3 years.

Goals: To analyse and visualize the dataset through various types of charts for public dissemination.

Research Questions which can be answered through this dataset:

1. Is there evidence of lack of planning by ward-level officials? This can be shown if many projects are being sanctioned/invoiced just before the fical year ends or right before/after/during rains (Check the seasonality of the project expenditure).

2. What kind of infrastucture are funds being sanctioned towards? Is it hard infrastructure such as Roads, Water Supply, etc. or softer infrastructure such as Parks & Sports and Lighting?

3. What are the different kind of anomalies that are present in the data?

Research Questions for which we will be needing additional datasets to be merged:

1. How does ward level data on project expenditure correlate with the electoral ward level data? Does party affliation play a big role? (I did create an electoral dataset of the 2016 GHMC elections for this) - This is still to be done.
